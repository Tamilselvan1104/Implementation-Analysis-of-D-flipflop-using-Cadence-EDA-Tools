### SCHEMATICSIMULATION :
PROCEDURE FOR CREATING THE SCHEMATIC SIMULATION -Commands to get into Cadence

1.	Right Click and open the terminal window
2.	Type the following commands as follows and press enter.
•	csh
•	source /cadence/install/cshrc
•	virtuoso 
Procedure for Schematic simulation using Cadence

1.	Now two windows must open i) virtuoso/command interpreter window ii)”Whats New…”
2.	Close the 2nd window
3.	Use 1st window i.e virtuoso window (CIW) for further processing.
i.	Create a New Library
ii.	Create Schematic Cell view.
iii.	Create the Symbol for schematic Cell view.
iv.	Create the test Cell view.
v.	Analog simulation by spectre

### Steps for Schematic Simulation using Cadence:

i)	Procedure for Creating New Library.
•	File –New – Library
•	Name: Give name for ur library Ex: VLSILAB_EXP_1
•	Enable Attach to an existing technology library, Click OK
•	Attach the library to the technology library gpdk045.Click OK

ii)	Create Schematic Cell view.
•	Go to 1st window i.e virtuoso (CIW)
•	File-New-Cell view
•	Setup the new file form
•	Library: Select the one you created.
•	Cell: Give the experiment name Ex: Inverter ViewSchematic
•	Type: Schematic press OK
•	Add the required components from the libraries and make the connections.
•	Go to instance fixed menu or use shortcut key “I” from keypad to go instances
•	Click on browse. This opens the library browser
•	Now select the appropriate library for components like 
•	Gpdk45 ------------------------nmos1v, pmos1v
•	Create Input and Output pins
•	Make the connections by using fixed narrow wire key
•	Click Check and Save button

iii)	Creating the Symbol for schematic Cell view

•	In the schematic window, execute 
•	Create – Cell view – From Cell view
•	The cell view from cell view window appears
•	Check Lib Name, Cell Name, From View name must be schematic Press ok
•	Now Symbol generation form appears. Click Ok If No changes required
•	A new window with with default symbol is created.
•	Edit the symbol if you want to give actual symbol shape else continue.
•	Execute Create-Cell view-from cell view
•	Library Name and Cell Name must be same which you have used for schematic. Press OK
•	Check for the position of pin side.Prss OK
•	Edit for the shape by Create-Shape-Choose required options to edit.

iv)	Creating the new test cell view

•	Go to CIW window, Execute File-New-Cell view
•	Setup the new file form
•	Library: Select the one you created.
•	Cell: Cell name must be different from the name used in schematic cell view. Ex: Inverter_test
•	View: Schematic
•	Type: Schematic press OK
•	Follow the step 3(ii) d to make the required connections

### Analog simulation by SPECTRE.
•	In test cell view window
•	Launch – ADE L(Analog Design Environment)
•	Execute Setup—Simulation/directory/Host A new window opens
•	Set the simulation window to spectre and click ok
•	Execute Analysis – Choose. A window opens.
•	Select the type and set the specifications and press OK
•	Execute Output s—to be plotted – Select on Schematic
• Then Select the INPUT WIRE(Vin ) and OUTPUT WIRE(Vout) from your test Schematic using mouse
•	Execute Simulation -- Net list and Run

Results:
The design and implementation of the D-flip-flop using Cadence EDA tools were successfully completed. The simulated results confirmed the correct operation of the flip-flop, with proper synchronization of the input data with the clock signal. Key performance parameters such as propagation delay, power consumption, and area utilization were evaluated, aligning with expected theoretical values.
